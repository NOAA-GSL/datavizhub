## Summary
A workflow request requires functionality that is not currently implemented in the Zyra CLI.

## Current State
- **Available commands used:** <list existing commands from manifest>
- **Missing functionality:** <describe the missing step or CLI command>

## Desired Behavior
- Add support for: <new command or option>
- Expected usage example:
  ```bash
  zyra <command> --options
  ```

## Implementation Plan (Proposal)
- [ ] Implement core functionality in `src/zyra/`
- [ ] Add tests in `tests/`
- [ ] Ensure comprehensive docstrings for auto-generated documentation
- [ ] Include example in sample workflows

## Context
<Explain why this functionality is needed, who benefits, and any dependencies.>

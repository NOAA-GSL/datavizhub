## Branching Workflow

To keep development organized, we use a two-branch model:

- **`main`** ‚Üí Stable, production-ready branch.  
  - Always passes tests and CI/CD.  
  - Used for tagged releases.  
  - Do **not** commit directly to `main`.

- **`staging`** ‚Üí Integration branch.  
  - Collects feature branches and fixes before merging into `main`.  
  - Used for testing, docs, and CI validation.  

### Rules
1. **Feature Development**
   - Branch off `staging`:  
     ```bash
     git checkout staging
     git pull origin staging
     git checkout -b feature/my-feature
     ```
   - Open a Pull Request (PR) into `staging`.

2. **Testing & Integration**
   - PRs are merged into `staging`.  
   - CI/CD runs against `staging`.  
   - Once stable, `staging` is merged into `main`.  

3. **Syncing Main & Staging**
   - Occasionally merge `main ‚Üí staging` to keep hotfixes and metadata aligned.  
   - Always merge `staging ‚Üí main` via PR when ready to release.

## Workflow Gap Issues & PRs

Zyra now uses structured **Workflow Gap** issue and PR templates to ensure new CLI functionality is properly tracked.

### Filing Bug Reports
- Use the `üêû Bug Report` template (`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md`).
- Provide clear steps to reproduce, expected vs. actual behavior, and environment details.

### Filing Feature Requests
- Use the `‚ú® Feature Request` template (`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md`).
- Describe the feature, motivation, proposed solution, and alternatives.
- Use this template only for enhancements that do **not** map directly to CLI commands.


### Filing Workflow Gap Issues
- Use the `‚ö° Workflow Gap / Missing Command` template (`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/workflow_gap.md`).
- Clearly describe:
  - Which CLI commands exist today
  - What is missing
  - Why the feature is needed
- The template will guide you to include an implementation plan and examples.

### Submitting PRs for Workflow Gaps
- All PRs that add CLI functionality should link to the related Workflow Gap issue.
- The PR template (`.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`) includes a checklist:
  - Add tests
  - Write comprehensive **docstrings** (for auto-generated docs)
  - Include examples in workflows
- Ensure all boxes are checked before requesting review.

By following these templates, contributors help keep Zyra‚Äôs CLI aligned with real workflows and ensure documentation stays accurate and reproducible.

---

## Pull Requests

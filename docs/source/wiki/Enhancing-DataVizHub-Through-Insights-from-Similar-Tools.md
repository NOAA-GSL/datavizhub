# **Enhancing DataVizHub Through Insights from Similar Tools**


## **Overview of DataVizHub and Its Goals**

**DataVizHub** is an open-source Python library designed as a modular pipeline for data-driven visualizations. It provides components for data transfer (FTP/HTTP/S3), processing (e.g. GRIB/NetCDF to images or video), and plotting (using Matplotlib with basemap overlays). Initially, it targets developers who can script custom workflows by composing these building blocks, rather than providing a ready-made user application. The project’s current focus has been generating **2:1 equirectangular global imagery** and videos suitable for NOAA’s *Science On a Sphere* (SOS) displays. The long-term vision, however, is to make DataVizHub accessible to a broader audience – including educators and the general public – as a tool for teaching and learning with scientific data visualizations.

To bridge the gap from a developer-centric library to a more user-friendly platform, we explore similar libraries and products. By examining both open-source projects and commercial visualization tools, we can identify features and approaches that would improve DataVizHub’s usability, expand its capabilities beyond SOS-style global maps, and ensure it remains free and open source.


## **Open-Source Visualization Tools and Libraries**

**NOAA Weather and Climate Toolkit ([WCT](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/wct/)):** A relevant example is NOAA’s WCT, a free cross-platform desktop application for visualizing weather and climate data. WCT offers a **graphical user interface** that allows users to easily load data (radar, satellite, model outputs, etc.), apply background maps, create animations, and export visuals. Notably, WCT can export images and even movies in multiple formats. It also supports data format conversion to widely used formats (GeoTIFF, netCDF, KMZ, Shapefiles, etc.) to enhance interoperability. A key takeaway for DataVizHub is WCT’s emphasis on *integrated data access* (it can fetch data from web services and OPeNDAP) and one-click visualization, which lowers the barrier for non-developers. Adopting similar capabilities – such as a simple GUI for loading datasets and a timeline slider for animation – would make DataVizHub attractive to educators who lack coding skills.

**[NASA Panoply](https://www.giss.nasa.gov/tools/panoply/):** NASA’s Panoply is another instructive open-source tool. It’s a Java-based GUI application that plots geo-referenced arrays (netCDF, HDF, GRIB, etc.) on maps. Panoply is very flexible in its mapping: it supports **over 200 map projections**, enables overlaying of continent outlines, and can produce regional or global plots. Users can slice multi-dimensional data (e.g. different vertical levels or times) and generate contour or line plots without writing code. Importantly, Panoply allows exporting animations as MP4 videos or sequences of images – a feature parallel to DataVizHub’s image-to-video pipeline. It even permits opening remote datasets via HTTP or from cloud buckets. The **ease-of-use** (opening a file and immediately visualizing with chosen color tables) demonstrates how DataVizHub could evolve: by integrating a GUI or wizard for common tasks (like selecting a dataset variable and generating a globe animation) and by supporting multiple projections and overlays. Panoply’s rich set of projections and the ability to do simple math operations on data (e.g., differencing two fields) suggests DataVizHub could extend beyond the equirectangular SOS format to more general geospatial visualizations.

**[Unidata IDV](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/idv/) / [McIDAS-V](https://www.ssec.wisc.edu/mcidas/software/v/):** These are advanced open-source visualization systems historically used in meteorology. *McIDAS-V*, for example, is a powerful tool that displays satellite and model data in 2D or 3D globes and allows interactive analysis. It’s Java-based and open source, and while it offers enormous functionality (scripting, 3D volume rendering, etc.), it has a steep learning curve. The key insight here is that DataVizHub might adopt **some 3D or interactive capabilities** in a lighter way – for instance, enabling a 3D globe preview of the generated visualization or integrating with a web-based globe library. Instead of fully replicating McIDAS-V complexity, DataVizHub can strike a balance: keep the backend processing pipeline, but offer optional interactive viewers for the output.

**Holoviz and Pangeo Ecosystem:** In Python’s data science stack, libraries like HoloViz (hvPlot, Panel) and the Pangeo ecosystem (Xarray) provide interactive visualization pipelines that could inform DataVizHub’s evolution. For example, using **hvPlot** with Xarray, one can quickly create an interactive map with a time slider for a NetCDF dataset in just a few lines of code. This suggests that DataVizHub could offer high-level shortcuts for common tasks (e.g., “plot this variable over time on a global map”) which under the hood use Xarray for data handling and Matplotlib or Bokeh for plotting. Similarly,

**Panel/[Streamlit](https://streamlit.io)** could be used to build simple web apps on top of DataVizHub’s backend – allowing an educator to adjust parameters from a browser. Streamlit, in particular, is an open-source Python framework for creating interactive data apps with minimal code. By wrapping DataVizHub functions in a Streamlit or Panel dashboard, DataVizHub could deliver a user-friendly UI where users select a dataset and time range, then generate an animation without writing Python. This approach leverages open-source tools to remain free, while dramatically improving approachability.

**[RealEarth Platform](https://www.wicoastalatlas.net/maps/realearth/):** *RealEarth*, developed by UW-Madison SSEC, is a web-based data discovery and visualization platform geared towards outreach. It provides **continuous, real-time visualization of Earth data** (satellite imagery, weather products, etc.) on an interactive map with an easy interface. Users can toggle layers on a map, adjust timelines, and see updates seamlessly. RealEarth’s success in engaging the public underscores the importance of an intuitive UI and live data integration. For DataVizHub, taking inspiration from RealEarth could mean implementing a web map front-end for browsing available visualizations or layering multiple data sources. While RealEarth uses a tile-streaming architecture (for performance) and is not purely a Python library, its **focus on outreach and quick visualization** aligns well with the goal of making DataVizHub appealing to educators. Integrating DataVizHub with a lightweight web map (perhaps via Leaflet or CesiumJS) could allow general users to explore the visualizations interactively, rather than only consuming pre-rendered videos.


## **UI-Driven Commercial Platforms and Their Features**

It’s also useful to examine **commercial visualization tools** for features that make them popular, even if DataVizHub will remain open source. Platforms like *[Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/)*, *[Power BI](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/products/power-bi)*, and *[ArcGIS Online](https://www.arcgis.com/index.html)* demonstrate best-in-class user experience for data visualization. Tableau, for instance, is known for its **user-friendly drag-and-drop interface** – creating complex charts and maps requires no coding, making it accessible to users of all skill levels. The emphasis on an intuitive UI (with instant visual feedback) is something DataVizHub could emulate by developing a front-end or GUI. For example, a “DataVizHub Studio” could let educators load a dataset and interactively choose visualization options (map or globe, color scales, animation speed) through menus rather than Python scripts.

Commercial GIS products like *ESRI’s ArcGIS* or *Google Earth Engine* offer powerful geospatial visualization without deep programming. ArcGIS StoryMaps, for example, let users create interactive map-based stories with text and multimedia, aimed at education and public communication. While these are proprietary, the concept of **storytelling and context** could be adopted in DataVizHub’s outputs. Perhaps the platform can generate not just raw visuals but also accompanying legend graphics or explanatory text to aid learning.

Another angle is the support for **multiple data types and analytical features**. Power BI and Tableau can ingest “any” data source and combine them seamlessly. In DataVizHub’s context, extending support beyond gridded climate data to include point observations, vector shapes (e.g., political boundaries, markers), or even non-geospatial charts could broaden its educational utility. For example, an educator might want to visualize not only a global temperature map but also a corresponding time-series graph of global average temperature. Commercial tools often integrate such capabilities (mashups of maps and charts in dashboards). DataVizHub could be extended with modules to generate complementary visualizations (like charts, bar graphs) to tell a fuller story.

Finally, commercial platforms highlight **collaboration and sharing** features – e.g., Tableau Public allows publishing interactive visualizations online. While DataVizHub might not aim to create a proprietary cloud service, it could integrate with existing sharing platforms. The current design already uploads videos to [Vimeo](https://www.vimeo.com/) and data to AWS S3 for dissemination. Building on this, the project could incorporate one-click publishing of visualizations to public galleries or enabling an **"Explorer mode"** where users anywhere can tweak parameters in a limited sandbox (similar to how Google Earth Engine allows users to run scripts in the cloud). This would greatly enhance its reach as an educational tool, fostering a community around open data visualization.


## **Extending Beyond 2:1 Equirectangular Globes**

Originally, DataVizHub’s visualization module was tailored to SOS-style global maps – essentially equirectangular projections where the left/right edges meet on the sphere. To *“extend this into other areas,”* several improvements are possible:



* **Additional Map Projections and Regions:** Borrowing a page from Panoply, DataVizHub could support many projections and regional subsets. Educators might want to create a North America regional map, a polar stereographic view, or any custom map to focus on specific areas. Python’s Cartopy or PROJ library could be leveraged to transform data into different map projections beyond the flat globe. Panoply’s ability to plot data on *any* projection (even unusual ones) with a click shows the value of flexibility. Implementing a projection parameter in DataVizHub’s `PlotManager` (and including more basemap overlays for different projections or backgrounds) would open up new use cases, from local environmental data to planetary science.

* **Vector and Annotation Overlays:** So far, DataVizHub uses static image overlays for basemap (perhaps an Earth image and political boundaries). This could be extended by allowing user-specified overlays, such as shapefiles (e.g. highlight a country) or dynamic annotations (text, markers for cities or data points). In educational settings, being able to annotate visualizations – e.g., label a hurricane or add a graph inset – can greatly improve comprehension. Some tools already do this: SOS playlists can add labels and external images (like legends) on top of [sphere content](https://sos.noaa.gov/support/sos/manuals/content-creation-guidelines/all/). DataVizHub could automate the creation of legends or captions as part of its pipeline, so the visuals are more self-explanatory for general audiences.

* **Interactive and 4D Visualization:** Perhaps the most exciting frontier is adding interactivity and true 4D (time) navigation. Advanced prototypes like Lockheed Martin’s *Agatha* platform demonstrate how users can explore data on an interactive 3D Earth with a time slider. Agatha is a high-end example – a “composable data pipeline and visualization platform” that lets users overlay multiple datasets on a globe and control the view (zoom, rotate) and time dynamically. It features a rich UI with layer toggles, search, and dynamic color legends. While Agatha is proprietary and built on game-engine tech (NVIDIA Omniverse), it points to features DataVizHub could gradually adopt in open-source form. For instance, integrating with a web-based globe like **[CesiumJS](https://cesium.com/platform/cesiumjs/)** or [NASA WorldWind](https://worldwind.arc.nasa.gov/) would allow DataVizHub outputs to be explored interactively in a browser. Instead of just producing a video, DataVizHub might produce a small web application (HTML/JavaScript) that lets the user play/pause the data over time and rotate the globe. This would immensely help educators during presentations – imagine a teacher not just showing a pre-rendered animation of ocean currents, but pausing it and rotating the Earth to focus on the Pacific when students ask questions.

* **Beyond Earth:** Another “other area” is applying the visualization pipeline to different domains. Since SOS supports planetary datasets too, DataVizHub could incorporate other planetary basemaps (Mars, for example) or non-geographical visualization (like abstract data projected in a 2:1 format for sphere display as art/science fusion). Additionally, the pipeline could be generalized to create flat videos for standard screens (not just the spherical-projection format). This would make it useful in creating visualizations for web or social media, increasing its appeal to science communicators. In essence, making the visualization module more general-purpose while keeping an option for SOS-format ensures the tool isn’t pigeonholed into one niche.



## **Making DataVizHub More User-Friendly**

Drawing inspiration from the above tools, here are key improvements to make DataVizHub easier to use and understand, especially for non-developers:



* **Graphical User Interface:** Implement an optional GUI or web interface. This could be a simple desktop app (electron or Tkinter-based) or a web dashboard. The interface would guide users through selecting a dataset (local file or remote source), choosing visualization options (map type, color palette, date range), and then either previewing the result or running the pipeline to produce an animation. A GUI would hide the command-line complexity and make the tool feel accessible. NOAA’s WCT and NASA’s Panoply both show that a well-designed GUI can attract a wide user base for complex data. Even a minimal interface with a few dropdowns and a “Generate” button could significantly lower the entry barrier.

* **Preconfigured Workflows and Examples:** Provide one-click examples or templates. For educators, it’s invaluable to have ready-to-use examples like “Plot global temperature anomaly for the past 30 days” or “Visualize real-time NOAA GOES satellite imagery on a spinning globe.” DataVizHub can include example scripts or an **examples gallery** (possibly as Jupyter notebooks or as functions in the package) that cover common use cases. This way, users don’t need to assemble the pipeline from scratch – they can modify an example. Clear, narrative documentation (with screenshots of outputs) will help users quickly grasp what the tool can do. The current README emphasizes components for developer; expanding it with an **“Introduction for Educators”** section or tutorial can make non-programmers feel more at home.

* **Integrated Data Access:** Simplify getting data into the pipeline. Instead of requiring users to manually download data to a folder, DataVizHub could integrate data sources directly. For instance, provide utility functions to fetch common datasets (via HTTPS, FTP, or APIs) given a dataset name or ID. The tool already has HTTP and FTP managers – building on these to include an internal catalog of popular datasets (with their URLs or API endpoints) would save users time and confusion. An educator might not know where to get, say, the latest ocean temperature data; a built-in catalog UI (inspired by SOS’s dataset catalog or RealEarth’s product list) would let them simply pick from a menu. This approach echoes the convenience of WCT’s ability to access NCEI web services directly.

* **Error Handling and Guidance:** To make the tool robust for general users, focus on clear error messages and guidance. If something goes wrong (e.g., wrong credentials, data not found, etc.), the software should inform in plain language and suggest solutions. Including a **FAQ or Troubleshooting** guide in documentation can pre-empt common pitfalls. Non-technical users appreciate when the software “speaks” their language instead of cryptic stack traces.

* **Community and Collaboration:** Encourage a community where educators and developers share custom visualizations or extensions. This could be via a gallery of user-contributed datasets or a forum for Q&A. Open-source projects thrive when users feel heard – for instance, Tableau Public’s community showcases visualizations, and in the open-source realm, tools like **Kepler.gl** have galleries of example maps. DataVizHub could incorporate a feature to export not just the final video, but also a lightweight **configuration file** describing the visualization (data source, color map, etc.). Sharing this config would allow others to replicate or tweak the visualization if they have the tool, fostering collaboration. Since the goal is to remain open-source, building an active user community can also attract contributions that improve the project continuously.



## **Conclusion**

By studying analogous projects, we see a spectrum from powerful code libraries to polished user-facing applications. **DataVizHub stands at an intersection** – with some effort it can evolve from a behind-the-scenes pipeline to a more holistic platform for scientific visualization. Key improvements include developing a user-friendly interface (drawing from GUI tools like WCT or web apps like RealEarth), broadening visualization capabilities (taking cues from Panoply’s multi-projection support and Agatha’s interactive globe), and providing rich, ready-to-use functionality so that even those unfamiliar with Python can benefit. Commercial tools like Tableau remind us that ease-of-use and immediate visual feedback are crucial for adoption, which can be achieved in open-source via thoughtful design.

Crucially, all these enhancements can be pursued while keeping the project **free and open-source**. There is a rich ecosystem of open libraries (for mapping, interactivity, data handling) that DataVizHub can integrate rather than reinvent. For example, using open web GIS engines or Python dashboard frameworks can provide interactivity without proprietary restrictions. Likewise, the wealth of free data (NOAA, NASA, etc.) can be leveraged through open APIs so that users don’t need paid data sources.

In summary, by learning from similar tools, DataVizHub can grow into a versatile educational platform. It can maintain its strength as a flexible pipeline for developers while adding layers of usability – friendly UIs, example-driven workflows, and interactive visualization – to welcome educators and the public. This dual approach will amplify DataVizHub’s impact, helping demystify scientific data through engaging visuals while adhering to NOAA’s mission of open science outreach. With incremental improvements inspired by the best features of existing solutions, DataVizHub could become a go-to open resource for visualizing the Earth system, whether on a six-foot sphere in a science center or on a laptop in a classroom.

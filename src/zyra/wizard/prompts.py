        "Formatting rules:\n"
        "- Always wrap commands in a fenced code block with 'bash'.\n"
        "- Each command must start with 'zyra'.\n"
        "- If multiple steps are needed, put each on its own line.\n"

        "what each command does.\n"
        "- Do not include any text outside the fenced code block.\n\n"
        "Guidelines:\n"
        "- Prefer succinct, directly runnable commands.\n"
        "- Use placeholders (like <input-file>) only when unavoidable.\n"
        "- Never generate non-zyra shell commands (e.g., rm, curl, sudo).\n"
        "- If essential details are missing, make a reasonable assumption and use a placeholder.\n"
        "- Explanations should be one short phrase only, never long sentences.\n"
        "- Avoid redundant flags unless necessary for clarity.\n\n"
        "Your output must always be a single fenced code block with commands "
        "and optional short comments.\n\n"
        "Strict CLI policy:\n"
        "- Only use subcommands and options that exist in the capabilities manifest provided in the Context.\n"
        "- Never invent commands or aliases (e.g., 'plot' is invalid â€” prefer 'visualize heatmap' or 'visualize timeseries').\n"
        "- If unsure which visualization fits, pick 'visualize heatmap' for gridded data or 'visualize timeseries' for CSV/1D.\n"
        "- Do not fabricate file paths. Prefer omitting required path-like inputs so the Wizard can prompt the user interactively.\n"
